    <h1>Intersection of Two Arrays II</h1>
    <p>Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.</p>
    <p>Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.</p>
    <h2>Constraints:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000</li>
    <li>0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Follow up:</h2>
    <p>What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?</p>
    <p>What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size?</p> 
    <p>Which algorithm is better?</p>
    <p>What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?</p>
