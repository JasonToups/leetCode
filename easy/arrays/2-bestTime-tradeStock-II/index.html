    <h1>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II</h1>
    <p>Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. <br /><br />
    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).<br /><br />
    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).</p>
    <h2>Example 1</h2>
    <p>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br/>
      Output: 7<br/>
      Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br/>
      Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.<br/>
