    <h1>Valid Sudoku</h1>
    <p>Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.</li>
      <li>Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.</li>
      <li>Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.</li>
    <li>Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.</li>
  </ul>
