    <h1>Rotate Image</h1>
    <p>You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).</p>
    <p>You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.</p>
