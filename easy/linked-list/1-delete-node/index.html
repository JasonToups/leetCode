    <h1><a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/553/" >Delete Node in a Linked List</a></h1>
    <p>Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.</p>
    <p>It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.</p>
    <h2>Constraints:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
        -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</li>
      <li>The value of each node in the list is unique.</li>
      <li>The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node</li>
    </ul>
