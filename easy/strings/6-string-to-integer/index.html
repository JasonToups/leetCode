    <h1><a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/884/" >String to Integer</a></h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII Table</a></h2>
    <p>Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).</p>
    <h2>The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.</li>
      <li>Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.</li>
      <li>Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.</li>
      <li>Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).</li>
      <li>If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.</li>
      <li>Return the integer as the final result.</li>
    </ol>  
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.</li>
      <li>Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.</li>
    </ul>
